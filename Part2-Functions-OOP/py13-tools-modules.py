# The import Statement:
"""
When you create a Python program, 
you split your code up into different files to avoid repetition. 

These files are known as modules

Python allows you to import entire modules or individual functions, classes or variables into other modules.

Python has built-in modules that we can import from as well. 
We do this with the "import" statement.
