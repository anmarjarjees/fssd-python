# Math: built-in libray
# Provides statandard mathematical functions
# using "import math"

# NOTE:
# As math is a built-in library it comes with Python,
# and there is no need to install it separately.


import math

print(math.pi)

print(math.sqrt(4))

# Challenge: math
# Steps:
# 1. At the top of your file, import the math module.
# 2. Declare a variable named num and assign it a value of 81.5
# 3. Declare a variable named round_up.
# 4. Using the ceil() method of the math module, round up the value of the num variable and assign the returned value to the round_up variable.
# 5. Print the value of the round_up variable to the terminal.
# 6. Declare a variable named round_down.
# 7. Using the floor() method of the math module, round down the value of the num variable and assign the returned value to the round_down variable.
# 8. Print the value of the round_down variable to the terminal.
# 9. Declare a variable named square_root.
# 10. Using the sqrt() method of the math module, get the square root of the round_down variable and assign the returned value to the square_root variable.
# 11. Print the value of the square_root variable to the terminal.
