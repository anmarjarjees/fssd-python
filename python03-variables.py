# variables stored in the memory (RAM)
# Computers have a hardware component called RAM (Random Access Memory).
# RAM is a storage medium for computers.
# Unlike a hard drive,
# RAM is volatile so any data stored in RAM will be lost after the computer has been shut down.


# var myNumer = 5 in JS

# A variable acts as a placeholder in memory for a piece of data
# to name or variables in python we use the _ for more than one word
# python naming conventions: text1_text2
my_number = 8

my_current_module = "Python"

print(my_number)  # 8

print(my_current_module)  # python

print(my_number, my_current_module)  # 8 python

# Conventions For Declaring Variables
Number = 1  # Capitalized
myNumber = 2  # Camel Case => in JS, PHP
MyNumber = 3  # Pascal Case => C#
number = 4  # lowercase => python
my_number = 5  # Lower Case with Underscore  => python

# Variables & Arithmetic: + - * /
first_number = 10
second_number = 5

print(first_number+second_number)  # 15
