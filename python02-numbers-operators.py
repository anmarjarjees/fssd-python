# download and install python
# Start => Python 3.8 => open python shell
# python shell is similar to JS console window
# This Shell window just for writing quick command in python

# Python syntax list:
# python file extension is .py

# + - * /
print(4 / 2)  # output 2.0

print(5 * 2)  # output 10

# the result of 2 to the power 3
# find: 2 * 2 * 2
# in Py: 2**3 => 2 * 2 * 2
print(2 ** 3)  # 2 * 2 * 2 => output is 8

# Modulo % => to return the remainder of division
print(4 % 2)  # the remainder is 0 because: even number % 2 => 0

# more example of exponent **
# find the result of 4 to the power of 2
# 4 * 4
print(4**2)  # output 16
# or
print(4 * 4)  # output 16

# Floor Division, the symbol is // to be explained later

# BEDMAS

# print the average of these two numbers 90 and 93:
print((90+93)/2)  # 91.5

print((1+1)**3)  # (1+1) => 2 ** 3 => 2 * 2 * 2 = 8
