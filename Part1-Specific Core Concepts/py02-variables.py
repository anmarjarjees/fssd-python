# variables stored in the memory (RAM)
# Computers have a hardware component called RAM (Random Access Memory).
# RAM is a storage medium for computers.
# Unlike a hard drive,
# RAM is volatile so any data stored in RAM will be lost after the computer has been shut down.


# var myNumber = 5 in JavaScript

# A variable acts as a placeholder in memory for a piece of data
# to name or variables in python we use the _ for more than one word
# python naming conventions: text1_text2
my_number = 8

my_current_module = "Python"

print(my_number)  # 8

print(my_current_module)  # python

print(my_number, my_current_module)  # 8 python
# Variables in Python:
# Variables are analogous to “boxes” that we can use to store,
# modify and reference values in a computer program

# *********************************************************************************
# IMPORTANT NOTE:
# In Python, there is no concept of variable declaration (As we had in JavaScript).
# A variable comes into existence only when it is assigned a value.
# If you try and use a variable name before it has a value assigned
# then you will get an error.
# *********************************************************************************

# Conventions For Creating Variables:
# ***********************************
# main-article like id or class values in HTML coding: id="main-article" or class="general-div"
Number = 1  # Capitalized
myNumber = 2  # CamelCase => in JS, PHP
MyNumber = 3  # PascalCase => C#
number = 4  # lowercase => python
my_number = 5  # snake_case => Words are separated by underscores - Lower Case with Underscore  => python

# Variables & Arithmetic: + - * /
first_number = 10
second_number = 5

print(first_number+second_number)  # 15

# Summary And Notes:
# Variable names must start with a regular letter (not a number),
# and all further characters should be either letters or digits or underscores.
# There is an exception to this rule which is that instance variables
# should start with an underscore.
# Instance variables are defined within methods in a Class.

# Another major/important topic to be explained later:
# Python Frameworks, Modules and Libraries
# 1) Pre-written Python code
# 2) To allow quick construction of projects
# 3) By using functions from frameworks or libraries
