# Right now we are using: CLI => Command Line Interface
# like VS code Terminal Window ("Powershell") to run and test our python code

# Later we we will use these two Python frameworks
# Flask and Django ==> GUI (Web Application to be run on the browser window)


# To escape any character we can use the \
# The escape character is simply a backslash (\)
# Single Quote \'
# Double Quote \"
print("Martin's car is Honda")
print('Martin\'s car is Honda')
print("I like to learn \"Python\"")

# New Line \n
# TAB \t
# Carriage Return \r
# Carriage return \r is often interpreted by the operating system in the same way,

print("Martin's \n car is Honda")
print("Martin's \t car is Honda")
print("Martin's \r car is Honda")


print("Apples and oranges,\" remarked John. \"Nope. Iâ€™d be inclined to disagree,\" replied Mike")

# Example below based on the last challenge of escape character topic
# But it will give use error (3 Problems): Just ignore them
# Anomalous backslash in string: '\
print(" /|\ ")
print("/ | \ ")
print(" \|/ ")
