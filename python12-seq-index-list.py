# Sequences, Indexing and Lists
# Ask the user to input any string and save it into a variable named "my_string":
my_string = input(
    "Input any text and we will tell you how many characters you have in your text (the length): ")

# in Python we have a "function" named len() to give us the length of any text
# Let's suppose if len() was a method for string class => my_string.len()
# but len() is a function => len(my_string)
print(len(my_string))

# Remember that in JS myString.length as a property

# Like in JS, String and List in Python have their index values to start from 0
print(
    f"So your first character in your text is \"{my_string[0]}\", and your second character is \"{my_string[1]}\"! Look we know everything")
# If you put only one charater => IndexError: string index out of range

# example
for one_char in my_string:
    print(one_char)

# When we have a group of items,
# we can store them in a list, so we have them all in the one place
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "peach", "pear", "plum", "orange"]

print(fruits)  # output: ['apple', 'banana', 'peach', 'pear', 'plum', 'orange']

# document.write("<ul>")
# for loop: document.write("<li>fruits[i]</li>")
# document.write("</ul>");

# or for loop:
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Let's print the second fruit which is in oue case is "banana" name in fruits:
print("Our second fruit is: ", fruits[1])  # Our second fruit is:  banana

# let's do the same using while loop:
# Use While loop structure to print the elements of fruits list
# Use the len() function to find the length of fruits list

# Please be advised that this loop counter will represent the index values of fruits list
# We know that computer (list in Py) is 0 based index so we need to start with 0

# While loop structure has 3 requirements:
counter = 0  # Step 1. the initial value of our loop counter
while counter < len(fruits):  # Step 2. the condition to keep the loop running
    # print the elements of this array:
    print(fruits[counter])
    # we need NOT to foreget changing the loop counter
    counter += 1  # Step 3. the counter value has to be incremented/decremented

# Letâ€™s take a look at the example below:
# Element      "apple"   "banana"   "peach"   "pear"   "plum"   "orange"
# Index         0         1          2         3        4        5
