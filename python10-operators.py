# Hint:
# - Thinking of True is 1 and False to be 0
# - Thinking of "and" to be * and "or" +
# - The result is either 1 or 0 (no 2)

# TRUE and TRUE => TRUE => 1 * 1 = 1
# TRUE and FALSE => FALSE => 1 * 0 = 0

# *****************
# Ternary Operator:
# *****************
# Sometimes we donâ€™t need to create lengthy if-else conditions,
# as it would be easier to work with a single one-line of code (simple formula).
# In this instance, weâ€™d use an if expression

# Example:
its_morning = False  # boolean variable with the value of "False"

# Simple if condition block (first):
if its_morning:  # if my_boolean_var == True OR has any value except "False"
    my_greeting = "Good morning"
else:
    my_greeting = "Good evening!"

print(my_greeting)

# the other way "Ternary Operator":
# our_variable = this_value if True else other_value
my_message = "Good morning" if its_morning else "Good evening!"
print(my_message)

# another example from a previous :
light = 'red'
# Task convert this into ternary Operator
if light == 'green':
    print('You may proceed')
else:
    print('Please wait here')

# with ternary operator, we can create a variable to get the returned value:
what_to_do = 'You may proceed' if light == 'green' else 'Please wait here'
print(what_to_do)

# Or we can place the full logic (Ternary Operator) inside print function

print('You may proceed' if light == 'green' else 'Please wait here')

# Another example of placing the entire ternary statement inside the print()
age = 22
print("You can register for this course" if age >=
      18 else 'Please contact your advisor')

# Even / Odd Number Check
num = 2
if num % 2 == 0:
    print('Even Number')
else:
    print('Odd Number')

result = 'Even Number' if num % 2 == 0 else 'Odd Number'
print(result)

# Challenge (Restaurant):
# 1. Create a boolean variable if the customer is "vegetarian": True or False
is_vegetarian = True  # Assuming that the customer is vegetarian

# 2. If condition and If ternary operator to print:
# "Please take the Vegetarian menu" <= if the customer is vegetarian
# "Please take the Normal Menu"

# First part using if condition full block:
if is_vegetarian:
    print("Please take the Vegetarian menu")
else:
    print("Please take the Normal Menu")

# Second part using the ternary operator:
# Hint: you can use a variable or direct print
menu = "Please take the Vegetarian menu" if is_vegetarian else "Please take the Normal Menu"
print(menu)
